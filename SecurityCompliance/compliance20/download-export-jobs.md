# Download export jobs

All exported data is added to a Microsoft Azure blob. This provides multiple options to handle the data downstream. There are several ways to access an Azure blob. One method is to use Azure Storage Explorer. This method supports simple connection, browsing and downloading. For more information, visit <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/blobs/storage-quickstart-blobs-storage-explorer>

1.  To download content after an export job is complete, go to the Exports tab and select an export job.

2.  Copy the text in the “Locations” section of the flyout.

This will add the export as an object in Storage Accounts/SAS-Attached Services/Blob Containers. You will be able to explore the export and download all or portions of the export.
