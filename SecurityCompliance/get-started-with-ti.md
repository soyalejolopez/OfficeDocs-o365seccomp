# Get started with Office 365 Advanced Threat Protection Plan 2 (formerly Office 365 Threat Intelligence)

If you are part of your organization's security team, you can use Threat Intelligence capabilities to protect your users from attacks. Office 365 Advanced Threat Protection Plan 2 (formerly Office 365 Threat Intelligence) helps security analysts and administrators keep users safe by bubbling up insights and identifying action based on what is happening in their your Office 365 environment. These insights are based on a comprehensive repository of threat intelligence data and systems to spot patterns that correspond to attack behaviors and suspicious activity.
  
Read this article to learn more about Threat Intelligence and how to get started.
  
## What is Threat Intelligence?

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Beginning in February 2019 and rolling out over the next several months, Office 365 Threat Intelligence is becoming Office 365 Advanced Threat Protection Plan 2, with additional threat protection capabilities. To learn more, see [Office 365 Advanced Threat Protection plans and pricing](https://products.office.com/exchange/advance-threat-protection) and the [Office 365 Advanced Threat Protection Service Description](https://docs.microsoft.com/office365/servicedescriptions/office-365-advanced-threat-protection-service-description).

Threat Intelligence is a collection of insights and information available in the Office 365 Security &amp; Compliance Center. These insights can help your organization's security team protect Office 365 users from attacks. Threat Intelligence monitors signals and gathers data from multiple sources, such as user activity, authentication, email, compromised PCs, and security incidents. Business decision makers and Office 365 global administrators, security administrators, and security analysts can all use the information Office 365 Threat Intelligence provides to understand and respond to threats against Office 365 users and intellectual property.
  
## Get acquainted with the Threat dashboard, Explorer, and Incidents

Threat Intelligence surfaces in the Security &amp; Compliance Center, as a set of tools and reports, including the [Threat dashboard](get-started-with-ti.md#dashboard), [Threat Explorer](get-started-with-ti.md#explorer), and [Incidents](get-started-with-ti.md#incidents).
  
### Threat dashboard

Use the Threat dashboard (this is also referred to as the [Security dashboard](security-dashboard.md)) to quickly see what threats have been addressed, and as a visual way to report to business decision makers how Office 365 services are securing your business.

To view and use this dashboard, in the Security &amp; Compliance Center, go to **Threat management** \> **Dashboard**.
  
### Threat Explorer

Use the Threat Explorer (this is also called Explorer) to analyze threats, see the volume of attacks over time, and analyze data by threat families, attacker infrastructure, and more. Threat Explorer is the starting place for any security analyst's investigation workflow.

To view and use this report, in the Security &amp; Compliance Center, go to **Threat management** \> **Explorer**.
  
 ### Incidents

Use the Incidents list (this is also called Investigations) to see a list of in flight security incidents. Incidents are used to track threats such as suspicious email messages, and to conduct further investigation and remediation.

## Learn more about Malware &amp; Threats

As part of the Office 365 Advanced Threat Protection Plan 2 offering, security analysts can review details about a known threat. This is useful to determine whether there are additional preventative measures/steps that can be taken to keep users safe.
