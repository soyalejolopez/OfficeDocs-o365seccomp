From here, you can go to [Compliance Manager](meet-data-protection-and-regulatory-reqs-using-microsoft-cloud.md) to review or edit your configurations and potentially improve your overall score.

You'll see additional widgets, such as one showing your organization's cloud app compliance, and another showing data about users with shared files, with links to [Cloud App Security](https://docs.microsoft.com/cloud-app-security/) or other tools where you can explore data.

## Protect

The **Protect** section contains widgets that provide you with high-level information about data loss prevention (DLP), third-party apps in use, shared files, shadow IT apps, and so on.

## Respond
